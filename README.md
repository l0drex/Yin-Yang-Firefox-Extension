# Yin-Yang Firefox extension
This is a small extension syncs the theme of Firefox with [Yin & Yang](https://github.com/daehruoydeef/Yin-Yang).
Please note that you need to have Yin Yang installed. 
If you change any settings in Yin & Yang, Firefox needs to be restarted.

The master branch should work with the original yin yang application.
If you want to use my fork of the yin yang application, you should use the branch l0drex_fork,
which supports the new message style sent by my fork.
