# Yin-Yang-Firefox-Extension
This is a small extension that changes the theme of firefox according to settings from [Yin-Yang](https://github.com/daehruoydeef/Yin-Yang).
Please note that you need Yin Yang for full support.
If you set a schedule in Yin-Yang, it can takes around 2 minutes for the extension to change the theme (it checks the time every 2 min).
